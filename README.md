Some simple tests for covering the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## HTML and CSS

The HTML and CSS files contain various incorrect lines, or misused code amongst the remaining acceptable code. The candidate just needs to go through it line by line and highlight things that they aren't happy with - it's very open. They may find things that aren't intentionally wrong, or they may think that "contenteditable" must surely be a mistake because they've never heard of it. The aim of these tests is to understand from them how deep their knowledge of these two really is. It's a starting point for multiple related discussions around best practices, or better solutions, or knowledge features in future specs that can help solve the same problem more elegantly.

Ideally the candidate will spot most of the problems, and go a further step of proposing better solutions for some of the code that isn't even intentionally under test.

## Lunar Rover

This is a JavaScript test that is quite open. Ideally the candidate will show a good enough knowledge of OOJS, jQuery, and testing. It's a pairing exercise, so small gaps in knowledge of OOJS or the specifics of Jasmine can be quickly filled: Personally I prefer to push them through the test to see how broad their knowledge is, and ultimately to see how quickly they learn new patterns.

Ideally the candidate will complete the test by appropriately modelling the 3 items as objects, tying the instances to the DOM, and capable of using jQuery (or I suppose any other approach) to manipulate the DOM as needed to achieve the goals. Testing wise the candidate may write the tests first, or as they go, whichever they feel comfortable with. Ultimately we're looking for familiarity with objects, familiarity with the DOM, and familiarity with tests.
